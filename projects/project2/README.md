# Project 2A: OCaml Warmup

Due: Wednesday June 17, 2020 at 23:59

Points: 65P/20SP/15S

## Preface
OCaml has an program and testing environment which might be different from what most students have seen. 
To ensure that the students have some resource on how to navigate 
 this environment Dr. Mamat has made [a youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36JnAcClOQ&t=21s)
Finally, there are various tools present in most editors and IDEs across platforms that are not needed but recommended. 
Some of them are itemized below: 

### vim
1. [ocp-indent](https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent): This takes care of basic formatting and indentation.
1. [vim-ocaml](https://github.com/ocaml/vim-ocaml): This talks to vim macros, and plugins and makes sure they behave.
1. [merlin](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin): This helps with code completion and type checking which will help in larger projects to come

### emacs

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to get you familiar with programming in OCaml. You will have to write a number of small functions, each of which is specified in three sections below.

We recommend you get started right away, going from top to bottom. The problems get increasingly more challenging, and in some cases later problems can take advantage of earlier solutions.

### Ground Rules
In your code, you may **only** use library functions found in the [`stdlib` module][stdlib doc]. This means you **cannot** use the List module or any other module. You may **not** use any imperative structures of OCaml such as references. The `@` operator is **not** allowed.

### Project Files
To begin this project, you will need to pull updates from the git repository. The following are the relevant files:

- OCaml Files
    - **src/basics.ml**: This is where you will write your code for all parts of the project.
    - **src/basics.mli**: This file is used to describe the signature of all the functions in the module. You do not need to edit or revise this file, but make sure it exists or your code will not compile.

### Submitting
You will submit this project to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/).  Click on the "P2a" project and submit _only_ your **basics.ml** file.  Don't zip your solution.  Any files other than basics.ml will be ignored.

### Notes on OCaml
OCaml is a lot different than languages you're likely used to working with, and we'd like to point out a few quirks here that may help you work your way out of common issues with the language.

- Some parts of this project are additive, meaning your solutions to earlier functions can be used to aid in writing later functions. Think about this in part 3.
- Unlike most other languages, = in OCaml is the operator for structural equality whereas == is the operator for physical equality. All functions in this project (and in this course, unless ever specified otherwise) are concerned with *structural* equality.
- The subtraction operator (-) also doubles as the negative symbol for `int`s and `float`s in OCaml. As a result, the parser has trouble identifying the difference between subtraction and a negative number. When writing negative numbers, surround them in parentheses. (i.e. `some_function 5 (-10)` works, but `some_function 5 -10` will give an error)

You can run the tests by doing `dune runtest -f`. We recommend you write student tests in `test/student.ml`.

You can interactively test your code by doing `dune utop src` (assuming you have `utop`). Then you should be able to use any of the functions. All of your commands in `utop` need to end with two semicolons (i.e. `;;`), otherwise it will appear that your terminal is hanging.

### Important Notes about this Project
1. If a function is not defined with the `rec` keyword, you can still add `rec` to the function definition. The only reason we don't include the `rec` keyword for certain functions is to show that the function can be written without recursion.
2. You can always add a helper function for any of the functions we ask you to implement, and the helper function can also be recursive.
3. You may move around the function definitions. In OCaml, in order to use one function inside of another, you need to define the function before it is called. For example, if you think that a function from Part 2 can be used to help you implement a function in Part 1, you can move your implementation of the function from the Part 2 section to before the function in Part 1. As long as you still pass the tests and you haven't created a syntax error, you are fine.
4. Pay special notice to the function types. Often times, you can lose sight of what you're trying to do if you don't remind yourself what all the arguments are and what you're trying to return.
5. You may rename arguments however you would like, but **do not modify function names**. Doing so will cause you to fail all tests.

## Part 1: Non-Recursive Functions
Implement the following functions that do not require recursion. Accordingly, these functions are defined without the `rec` keyword, but **you MAY add the `rec` keyword to any of the following functions or write a recursive helper function**. Just remember that if you write a helper function, it must be defined in the file before it is called.

#### rev_tup tup
- **Type**: `'a * 'b * 'c -> 'c * 'b * 'a`
- **Description**: Returns a 3-tuple in the reverse order of `tup`.
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
rev_tup (1, 2, 3) = (3, 2, 1)
rev_tup (1, 1, 1) = (1, 1, 1)
rev_tup ("a", 1, "c") = ("c", 1, "a")
```

#### abs x
- **Type**: `int -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the absolute value of `x`.
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
abs 1 = 1
abs (-5) = 5
```

#### area x y
- **Type**: `int * int -> int * int -> int`
- **Description**: Takes in the Cartesian coordinates (2-dimensional) of any pair of opposite corners of a rectangle and returns the area of the rectangle. The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the axes.
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
area (1, 1) (2, 2) = 1
area (2, 2) (1, 1) = 1
area (2, 1) (1, 2) = 1
area (0, 1) (2, 3) = 4
area (1, 1) (1, 1) = 0
area ((-1), (-1)) (1, 1) = 4
```

#### volume x y
- **Type**: `int * int * int -> int * int * int -> int`
- **Description**: Takes in the Cartesian coordinates (3-dimensional) of two opposite corners of a rectangular prism and returns its volume. The sides of the rectangular prism are parallel to the axes.
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
volume (1, 1, 1) (2, 2, 2) = 1
volume (2, 2, 2) (1, 1, 1) = 1
volume (0, 1, 2) (2, 3, 5) = 12
volume (1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 1) = 0
volume ((-1), (-1), (-1)) (1, 1, 1) = 8
```

#### equiv_frac (a, b) (x, y)
- **Type**: `int * int -> int * int -> bool`
- **Description**: Takes in two fractions in the form of 2-tuples, a/b and x/y, and returns whether or not the two fractions are equivalent. In the case either denominator is zero, return `false`. The optimal solution does not require recursion, but again, you **may** add the `rec` keyword or define your own recursive helper function if you would like.
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
equiv_frac (1, 2) (2, 4) = true
equiv_frac (2, 4) (1, 2) = true
equiv_frac (1, 2) (1, 2) = true
equiv_frac (3, 12) (2, 6) = false
equiv_frac (1, 2) (3, 4) = false
equiv_frac (1, 0) (2, 0) = false
```

## Part 2: Recursive Functions
Implement the following functions using recursion.

#### factorial x
- **Type**: `int -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the factorial of `x`.
- **Assumptions**: `x` is non-negative, and we will **not** test your code for integer overflow cases.
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
factorial 3 = 6
factorial 2 = 2
factorial 1 = 1
factorial 0 = 1
```

#### pow x p
- **Type**: `int -> int -> int`
- **Description**: Returns `x` raised to the power `p`.
- **Assumptions**: `p` is non-negative, and we will **not** test your code for integer overflow cases.
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
pow 3 1 = 3
pow 3 2 = 9
pow (-3) 3 = -27
```

#### tail x num
- **Type**: `int -> int -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the last `num` digits of `x`. If there are fewer than `num` digits in `x`, return `x` in its entirety.
- **Assumptions**: `num` and `x` are both non-negative.
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
tail 154 1 = 4
tail 154 2 = 54
tail 154 3 = 154
tail 154 4 = 154
tail 154 0 = 0
```

#### len x
- **Type**: `int -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the number of numerical digits in `x`.
- **Assumptions**: None
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
len 1 = 1
len 10 = 2
len 0 = 1
len 15949 = 5
len (-1234) = 4
len (00004) = 1
```

#### contains sub x
- **Type**: `int -> int -> bool`
- **Description**: Returns whether `sub`, represented as decimal digits with no leading zeros, can be found (continuously) within the digits of `x`.
- **Assumptions**: `sub` and `x` are both non-negative.
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
contains 1 1 = true
contains 1 19 = true
contains 445 1544533 = true
contains 123 1243 = false
contains 123 321 = false
```


## Part 3: Lists

#### get idx lst
- **Type**: `int -> 'a list -> 'a`
- **Description**: Returns the element at the index `idx` in the list `lst`. If `idx` is past the bounds of `lst`, raise an error using `failwith "Out of bounds"`.
- **Assumptions**: `idx` is non-negative.
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
get 0 [26; 11; 99] = 26
get 1 [26; 11; 99] = 11
get 2 [26; 11; 99] = 99
get 3 [26; 11; 99] = Exception
get 0 ["a"; "b"] = "a"
get 1 ["a"; "b"] = "b"
get 2 ["a"; "b"] = Exception
```

#### reverse lst
- **Type**: `'a list -> 'a list`
- **Description**: Returns a list with the elements of `lst` but in reverse order.
- **Assumptions**: None
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
reverse [] = []
reverse [1] = [1]
reverse [1; 2; 3] = [3; 2; 1]
reverse ["a"; "b"; "c"] = ["c"; "b"; "a"]
```

#### combine lst1 lst2
- **Type**: `'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list`
- **Description**: Returns a list with the elements of `lst1` followed by the elements of `lst2`. The elements within each list must be in the same order.
- **Assumptions**: None
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
combine [] [] = []
combine [] [3; 4] = [3; 4]
combine [1; 2; 3; 4] [3; 4; 5] = [1; 2; 3; 4; 3; 4; 5]
combine ["a"] ["b"] = ["a"; "b"]
```

#### rotate shift lst
- **Type**: `int -> 'a list -> 'a list`
- **Description**: Move every element over in `lst` to the left by the given `shift` (looping around).
- **Assumptions**: `shift` is non-negative.
- **Important Note**: None of the public or semipublic tests check whether this function works. Write your own tests to verify that your behavior is what you would expect!
- **Examples:**
```ocaml
rotate 0 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"]
rotate 1 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["b"; "c"; "d"; "a"]
rotate 2 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["c"; "d"; "a"; "b"]
rotate 3 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["d"; "a"; "b"; "c"]
rotate 4 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"]
rotate 5 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["b"; "c"; "d"; "a"]
```

## Academic Integrity
Please **carefully read** the academic honesty section of the course syllabus. **Any evidence** of impermissible cooperation on projects, use of disallowed materials or resources, or unauthorized use of computer accounts, **will be** submitted to the Student Honor Council, which could result in an XF for the course, or suspension or expulsion from the University. Be sure you understand what you are and what you are not permitted to do in regards to academic integrity when it comes to project assignments. These policies apply to all students, and the Student Honor Council does not consider lack of knowledge of the policies to be a defense for violating them. Full information is found in the course syllabus, which you should review before starting.
